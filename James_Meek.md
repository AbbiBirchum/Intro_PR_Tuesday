Hi my name is James Meek. I have worked in IT for over 20 years from Unix admin, windows admin, systems admin, and Systems support. I have had lots of exposure to programming but never had time to master it as I was wearing so many hats. I am now semi-retired working part-time with USPS. I think now is the time for me to learn what I have always loved programming. I am so happy to be part of CodeYou.
